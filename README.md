# Piscasda API interactive shell

For my current customer I'm communicate with the Piscada Cloud to extract my IoT / controller devices. My IoT / controller devices are basically "black boxes" that are pushing timeseries data to the Piscada Cloud.

Now, Piscada does provide some API documentation. But, since I'm constantly testing / extracting info to debug and just "check" stuff I wanted a simpler way than just have some shell scripts with predefined curl commands.

Therefore I created this "shell". It's mostly created for my own usage - but, maybe it can help others as well.


## Installation

It's a python3 based CLI which also includes its own "python module" that can easily be used by others.
